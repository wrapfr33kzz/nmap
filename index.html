                <h3>what is nmap</h3>
                <p>Nmap is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon.
                     Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on 
                     a computer network by sending packets and analyzing 
                     the responses. Nmap provides a number of features for
                      probing computer networks, including host discovery and
                       service and operating system detection. </p>

                <h3>use of nmap</h3>
                <p>Nmap allows you to scan your network 
                    and discover not only everything connected to it,
                     but also a wide variety of information about what's 
                     connected, what services each host is operating, and so on.
                      It allows a large number of scanning techniques, such as UDP,
                       TCP connect (), TCP SYN (half-open), and FTP</p>

                <h3>nmap example</h3>
                <p>Nmap, or Network Mapper, 
                    is an open source Linux command line tool 
                    for network exploration and security auditing.
                     With Nmap, server administrators can quickly reveal 
                     hosts and services, search for security issues, 
                     and scan for open ports.</p>
